Prove De Morgan’s Law with truth tables. Show that not (A or B) equals not A and not B for all possible boolean values of A and B.

In other words, solve not (A or B) four times for each of the following values of A and B.

A = true, B = true
A = true, B = false
A = false, B = true
A = false, B = false
Then do it again (four more times) for not A and not B.

In the end, you should have collected eight answers (all either true or false).

To help organize your answers, fill in two truth tables, one for each expression.

A = true	A = false
B = true		
B = false		
Each table cell represents a particular combination of A (true or false) and B (true or false). For every combination, fill in the corresponding value - 2 truth tables, 4 boxes each, 8 boxes in total, one for each of your answers.

Submit your table cell values like this:

not (A or B)

true,true
true,true
not A and not B

false,false
false,false
This, of course, is not the correct answer.

Hint: If you do this correctly, both tables should have the same values. That’s the proof of DeMorgan’s Law.
